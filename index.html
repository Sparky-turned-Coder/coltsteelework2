      <h1>Cheetah</h1>
      <p>
        The <b>cheetah <i>(Acinonyx jubatus)</i></b> is a large
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae">cat</a> and the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastest_animals">fastest</a> land
        animal. It has a tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur that is marked
        with evenly spaced, solid black spots. The head is small and rounded, with
        a short <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snout">snout</a> and black
        tear-like facial streaks. It reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder,
        and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft
        11 in). Adults weigh between <span class="number">21</span> and <span class="number">65</span> kg (<span class="number">46</span> and <span class="number">143</span> lb). The cheetah is
        capable of running at <span class="number">93</span> to <span class="number">105</span> km/h (<span class="number">58</span> to <span class="number">65</span> mph); it has evolved
        specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs
        and a long tail.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cheetah was first
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_description">described</a>
        in the late 18th century. Four subspecies are recognised today that are
        native to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa">Africa</a> and
        central <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran">Iran</a>. An African
        subspecies was
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_cheetah_translocation_to_India"
          >introduced to India</a>
        in 2022. It is now distributed mainly in small, fragmented populations in
        northwestern,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Africa">eastern</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa"
          >southern Africa</a>
        and central Iran. It lives in a variety of habitats such as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna">savannahs</a> in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serengeti">Serengeti</a>, arid
        mountain ranges in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara">Sahara</a>, and hilly

          The vernacular name "cheetah" is derived from Hindustani Urdu: چیتا and
          Hindi: चीता (ćītā).<sup>[3]</sup>This in turn comes from Sanskrit: चित्रय
          (Chitra-ya) meaning 'variegated', 'adorned' or 'painted'.<sup>[4]</sup> In the past,
          the cheetah was often called "hunting leopard" because they could be tamed
          and used for coursing.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah#cite_note-marker1-5">[5]</a></sup> The generic name Acinonyx probably derives from
          the combination of two Greek words: ἁκινητος (akinitos) meaning 'unmoved'
          or 'motionless', and ὄνυξ (onyx) meaning 'nail' or 'hoof'.<sup>[6]</sup> A rough
          translation is "immobile nails", a reference to the cheetah's limited
          ability to retract its claws.<sup>[7]</sup> A similar meaning can be obtained by the
          combination of the Greek prefix a– (implying a lack of) and κῑνέω (kīnéō)
          meaning 'to move' or 'to set in motion'.<sup>[8]</sup> The specific name jubatus is
          Latin for 'crested, having a mane'.<sup>[9]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          A few old generic names such as Cynailurus and Cynofelis allude to the
          similarities between the cheetah and canids.<sup>[10]</sup>

      </p>
      <p>
        In 1777, Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber described the cheetah based
        on a skin from the Cape of Good Hope and gave it the scientific name Felis
        jubatus.[11] Joshua Brookes proposed the generic name Acinonyx in
        1828.[12] In 1917, Reginald Innes Pocock placed the cheetah in a subfamily
        of its own, Acinonychinae,[13] given its striking morphological
        resemblance to the greyhound and significant deviation from typical felid
        features; the cheetah was classified in Felinae in later taxonomic
        revisions.[14]
      </p>
        <p>
          In the 19th and 20th centuries, several cheetah zoological specimens were
          described; some were proposed as subspecies.[15] A South African specimen
          with notably dense fur was proposed as (Felis lanea) by Philip Sclater in
          1877 and became known as the "woolly cheetah".[16] Its classification as a
          species was mostly disputed.[17] There has been considerable confusion in
          the nomenclature of the cheetah and leopard (Panthera pardus) as authors
          often confused the two; some considered "hunting leopards" an independent
          species, or equal to the leopard.[18][19]
        </p>
      <h4>Subspecies</h4>

      


      <p>
        In 1975, five cheetah subspecies were considered valid taxa: A. j. hecki,
        A. j. jubatus, A. j. raineyi, A. j. soemmeringii and A. j. venaticus.[20]
        In 2011, a phylogeographic study found minimal genetic variation between
        A. j. jubatus and A. j. raineyi; only four subspecies were identified.[21]
        In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist
        Group revised felid taxonomy and recognised these four subspecies as
        valid. Their details are tabulated below:[20]

      </p>
      <p>
        The cheetah's closest relatives are the cougar (Puma concolor) and the
        jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi).[20] Together, these three species
        form the Puma lineage, one of the eight lineages of the extant felids; the
        Puma lineage diverged from the rest 6.7 mya. The sister group of the Puma
        lineage is a clade of smaller Old World cats that includes the genera
        Felis, Otocolobus and Prionailurus.[30]
      </p>
        <p>
          The oldest cheetah fossils, excavated in eastern and southern Africa, date
          to 3.5–3 mya; the earliest known specimen from South Africa is from the
          lowermost deposits of the Silberberg Grotto (Sterkfontein).[2][8] Though
          incomplete, these fossils indicate forms larger but less cursorial than
          the modern cheetah.[31] The first occurrence of the modern species A.
          jubatus in Africa may come from Cooper's D, a site in South Africa dating
          back to 1.5 to 1.4 Ma, during the Calabrian stage.[32] Fossil remains from
          Europe are limited to a few Middle Pleistocene specimens from Hundsheim
          (Austria) and Mosbach Sands (Germany).[33] Cheetah-like cats are known
          from as late as 10,000 years ago from the Old World. The giant cheetah (A.
          pardinensis), significantly larger and slower compared to the modern
          cheetah, occurred in Eurasia and eastern and southern Africa in the
          Villafranchian period roughly 3.8–1.9 mya.[14][34] In the Middle
          Pleistocene a smaller cheetah, A. intermedius, ranged from Europe to
          China.[2] The modern cheetah appeared in Africa around 1.9 mya; its fossil
          record is restricted to Africa.[31]
        </p>
        <p>
          Extinct North American cheetah-like cats had historically been classified
          in Felis, Puma or Acinonyx; two such species, F. studeri and F. trumani,
          were considered to be closer to the puma than the cheetah, despite their
          close similarities to the latter. Noting this, palaeontologist Daniel
          Adams proposed Miracinonyx, a new subgenus under Acinonyx, in 1979 for the
          North American cheetah-like cats;[35] this was later elevated to genus
          rank.[36] Adams pointed out that North American and Old World cheetah-like
          cats may have had a common ancestor, and Acinonyx might have originated in
          North America instead of Eurasia.[35] However, subsequent research has
          shown that Miracinonyx is phylogenetically closer to the cougar than the
          cheetah;[37] the similarities to cheetahs have been attributed to parallel
          evolution.[30]
        </p>
        <p>
          The three species of the Puma lineage may have had a common ancestor
          during the Miocene (roughly 8.25 mya).[35][38] Some suggest that North
          American cheetahs possibly migrated to Asia via the Bering Strait, then
          dispersed southward to Africa through Eurasia at least 100,000 years
          ago;[39][40][41] some authors have expressed doubt over the occurrence of
          cheetah-like cats in North America, and instead suppose the modern cheetah
          to have evolved from Asian populations that eventually spread to
          Africa.[37][42] The cheetah is thought to have experienced two population
          bottlenecks that greatly decreased the genetic variability in populations;
          one occurred about 100,000 years ago that has been correlated to migration
          from North America to Asia, and the second 10,000–12,000 years ago in
          Africa, possibly as part of the Late Pleistocene extinction
          event.[40][43][44]

      <p>
        The diploid number of chromosomes in the cheetah is 38, the same as in
        most other felids.[45] The cheetah was the first felid observed to have
        unusually low genetic variability among individuals,[46] which has led to
        poor breeding in captivity, increased spermatozoal defects, high juvenile
        mortality and increased susceptibility to diseases and infections.[47][48]
        A prominent instance was the deadly feline coronavirus outbreak in a
        cheetah breeding facility of Oregon in 1983 which had a mortality rate of
        60%, higher than that recorded for previous epizootics of feline
        infectious peritonitis in any felid.[49] The remarkable homogeneity in
        cheetah genes has been demonstrated by experiments involving the major
        histocompatibility complex (MHC); unless the MHC genes are highly
        homogeneous in a population, skin grafts exchanged between a pair of
        unrelated individuals would be rejected. Skin grafts exchanged between
        unrelated cheetahs are accepted well and heal, as if their genetic makeup
        were the same.[50][51]
      </p>
        <p>
          The low genetic diversity is thought to have been created by two
          population bottlenecks from about 100,000 years and about 12,000 years
          ago, respectively.[40] The resultant level of genetic variation is around
          0.1–4% of average living species, lower than that of Tasmanian devils,
          Virunga gorillas, Amur tigers, and even highly inbred domestic cats and
          dogs.[48]
        </p>
        <p>
          Selective retention of gene variants (Duplication) has been found in 10
          genes candidates to explain energetics and anabolism related to muscle
          specialization in cheetahs.[40][48]
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Regulation of muscle contraction (Five genes: ADORA1, ADRA1B, CACNA1C,
            RGS2, SCN5A).
          </li>
          <li>Physiological stress response (Two genes: ADORA1, TAOK2).</li>
      
          <li>
            Negative regulation of catabolic process (Four genes: APOC3, SUFU, DDIT4,
            PPARA).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Potentially harmful mutations has been found in a gene related to
          spermatogenesis (AKAP4). This could explain the high proportion of
          abnormal sperma in male cheetahs and poor reproductive success in the
          species.[40][48]
        </p>
      <h4>King Cheetah</h4>
              <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/King_cheetah.jpg/255px-King_cheetah.jpg" alt="A unique Cheetah with 3 unbroken lines traveling down its back, where on other cheetahs it would be spots">
        <p>
          The king cheetah is a variety of cheetah with a rare mutation for
          cream-coloured fur marked with large, blotchy spots and three dark, wide
          stripes extending from the neck to the tail.[52] In Manicaland, Zimbabwe,
          it was known as nsuifisi and thought to be a cross between a leopard and a
          hyena.[53] In 1926, Major A. Cooper wrote about a cheetah-like animal he
          had shot near modern-day Harare, with fur as thick as that of a snow
          leopard and spots that merged to form stripes. He suggested it could be a
          cross between a leopard and a cheetah. As more such individuals were
          observed it was seen that they had non-retractable claws like the
          cheetah.[54][55]
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1927, Pocock described these individuals as a new species by the name
          of Acinonyx rex ("king cheetah").[54] However, in the absence of proof to
          support his claim, he withdrew his proposal in 1939. Abel Chapman
          considered it a colour morph of the normally spotted cheetah.[56] Since
          1927, the king cheetah has been reported five more times in the wild in
          Zimbabwe, Botswana and northern Transvaal; one was photographed in
          1975.[53]
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1981, two female cheetahs that had mated with a wild male from
          Transvaal at the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre (South Africa) gave
          birth to one king cheetah each; subsequently, more king cheetahs were born
          at the centre.[56] In 2012, the cause of this coat pattern was found to be
          a mutation in the gene for transmembrane aminopeptidase (Taqpep), the same
          gene responsible for the striped "mackerel" versus blotchy "classic"
          pattern seen in tabby cats.[57] The appearance is caused by reinforcement
          of a recessive allele; hence if two mating cheetahs are heterozygous
          carriers of the mutated allele, a quarter of their offspring can be
          expected to be king cheetahs.[58]
