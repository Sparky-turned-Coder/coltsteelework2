This repository is simply a place to keep all the code projects I'm doing as I work my way through Colt Steele's Web Dev Udemy Bootcamp.

So we learned that if I create this README remotely (on Github) instead of locally with the rest of my files, it creates an error when pushing new changes to the repo. To fix it, I had to pull the remotely created README file to my local file, and the push everything back to Github repo.  Lesson learned.

We can use this for notes that we take as we work though the bootcamp. Keeping up with it along with all our project files. This is fucking cool.  :D

Started the CSS section of Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp today, 5/27/2025. Discovered some good color pickers, freshened up on CSS syntax.

Cloned my Github repo onto seperate laptop today, 5/29/2025, so that I can work on my projects at home and away, pushing and pulling through bash.

Finished section 6 of Colt Steele's web dev bootcamp on, 5/30/2025.
