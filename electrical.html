    <h3>A poem by an Electrician who doesn't write poetry.</h3>
   <p>
    I'm an electrican. <br>
    An electrical dude. <br>
    I can rhyme when I want, <br>
    But do I even want to? <br>
    This is a little silly, <br>
    But also kinda fun. <br>
    But if I really think about it, <br>
    I should probably be done.
